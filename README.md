# TwitterMapperPatternsUBCx
This repository contains the final project for UBCx course Software Construction: Object-Oriented Design
Implemented mandatory features:
- Add two operators "and","or" to use them in search box like "apple and banana"
- Display marker with color of the corresponding query
- Display a small image of the tweet on the marker
- Display tooltip consisting of larger images and text of the tweets under cursor

Extra features:
- A larger marker with image appears when there is room for it. So images do not overlap each other(zoom in to make more space for markers).
